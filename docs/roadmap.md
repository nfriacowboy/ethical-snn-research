# Project Roadmap

## Overview
Multi-phase investigation of ethical behavior emergence in SNNs using dual-process theory.

---

## Phase 1: Dual-Process Architecture (Current)
**Timeline**: January 2026 - April 2026

### Goals
- Implement survival-only SNN (SNN-S)
- Implement ethical SNN (SNN-E)
- Compare behavioral outcomes in grid-world simulations

### Milestones
- [x] Pre-registration on OSF
- [ ] Environment implementation (Week 1-2)
- [ ] SNN-S implementation (Week 2-3)
- [ ] SNN-E implementation and pre-training (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Data collection (100 runs × 2 conditions) (Week 5-8)
- [ ] Statistical analysis (Week 9-11)
- [ ] Manuscript preparation (Week 11-14)

### Deliverables
- Published dataset on OSF
- Open-source code repository
- Pre-print submission

---

## Phase 2: Multi-Level Selection (Planned)
**Timeline**: May 2026 - September 2026

### Goals
- Implement group-level selection pressures
- Test altruistic behavior emergence
- Explore kin selection vs. group selection

### Hypotheses
- H2.1: Group selection promotes cooperation
- H2.2: Ethical networks evolve stronger in group contexts
- H2.3: Kin recognition emerges from network structure

### Key Changes
- Multi-organism families/groups
- Genetic inheritance mechanisms
- Inter-group competition scenarios

---

## Phase 3: Petri Net Integration (Planned)
**Timeline**: October 2026 - February 2027

### Goals
- Model ethical reasoning as Petri net processes
- Integrate symbolic reasoning with neural processing
- Test hybrid neuro-symbolic decision-making

### Technical Approach
- Petri nets represent ethical rules/norms
- SNN outputs activate Petri net transitions
- Petri net state modulates SNN processing

### Research Questions
- Can symbolic ethics guide emergent behavior?
- How do learned rules interact with innate drives?
- Does hybrid architecture improve generalization?

---

## Phase 4: Real-World Scenarios (Aspirational)
**Timeline**: 2027+

### Potential Directions
- Robotic implementations (physical embodiment)
- Social dilemma games (Prisoner's Dilemma, Public Goods)
- Human-AI interaction studies
- Multi-agent negotiation scenarios

---

## Success Criteria

### Scientific
- [ ] 3+ peer-reviewed publications
- [ ] Reproducible results across labs
- [ ] Novel insights into ethical AI design

### Technical
- [ ] Open-source framework adoption
- [ ] Benchmark dataset creation
- [ ] Integration with existing SNN libraries

### Impact
- [ ] Conference presentations (CogSci, NeurIPS, ALIFE)
- [ ] Collaboration with ethics/philosophy researchers
- [ ] Public engagement (blog posts, talks)

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Null results Phase 1 | Pre-registered, publishable regardless |
| Computational limitations | Cloud compute or cluster access |
| Ethical concerns about "artificial ethics" | Ongoing consultation with bioethicists |
| Reproducibility issues | Containerization, detailed logging |

---

## Resource Requirements

### Current (Phase 1)
- 1 researcher (full-time)
- GPU compute (~200 GPU-hours)
- OSF storage (~100GB)

### Future Phases
- Potential collaboration with neuroscience lab
- Access to robotics equipment (Phase 4)
- Funding for conferences/publications
